# satisfactoryBluePrints
Used to store and share Satisfactory Blueprint files between systems
Satisfactory is a game where you design and build factories in a 3D open world. Factories can be very complicated and heavily optimized, to help players build faster
the developers, Coffee Stain Studios, has added a built in Blueprint system. This allows you to design prefabricated sections of factories at a limited size, 
to build extremely complicated or large areas quickly and repeatedly. While the games save data is shared through the steam cloud, Blueprint files are not.
